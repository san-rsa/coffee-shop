# Coffee Shop Backend

### Setup Auth0

1. Create a new Auth0 Account
2. Select a unique tenant domain
3. Create a new, single page web application
7. Test your endpoints with [Postman](https://getpostman.com).
   - Register 2 users - assign the Barista role to one and Manager role to the other.
   - Sign into each account and make note of the JWT.
   - Import the postman collection `./starter_code/backend/udacity-fsnd-udaspicelatte.postman_collection.json`
   - Right-clicking the collection folder for barista and manager, navigate to the authorization tab, and including the JWT in the token field (you should have noted these JWTs).
   - Run the collection and correct any errors.
   - Export the collection overwriting the one we've included so that we have your proper JWTs during review!

### Implement The Server

There are `@TODO` comments throughout the `./backend/src`. We recommend tackling the files in order and from top to bottom:

1. `./src/auth/auth.py`
2. `./src/api.py`
